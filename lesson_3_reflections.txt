When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would want to use a remote repository rather than a local repository if
    you want to be able to work on the files from multiple computers or if multiple
    developers want to collaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might want to always pull changes manually because you may want to have a different
    local version of a file that won't be overwritten by Git automatically at a time that
    might not be beneficial.
