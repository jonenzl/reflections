When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would want to use a remote repository rather than a local repository if
    you want to be able to work on the files from multiple computers or if multiple
    developers want to collaborate.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might want to always pull changes manually because you may want to have a different
    local version of a file that won't be overwritten by Git automatically at a time that
    might not be beneficial.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

    Forks are a copy of a repository, allowing you to freely experiment with changes
    without affecting the original project. Clones are also a copy or a repository, but
    any changes that are pushed will modify the original. Branches allow you to
    experiment within an existing repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is
    that you can continue to work and make changes offline. You can then merge these changes
    at a later time.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    To collaborate without using Git or GitHub we would have to share files back and forth
    and copy, paste, and delete changes to combine the files into a master version. It would be easier
    in that you wouldn't have to figure out how to use Git or GitHub. However, it would be more difficult
    to keep the master file up to date and free of errors.
